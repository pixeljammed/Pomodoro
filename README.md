# A pomodoro timer app, written in SwiftUI



## **Progress to Date**

#### Project Title:
Pomodoro study timer app for macOS

#### Project Outline:
The pomodoro study technique is meant for people who often have trouble focusing. It works by splitting work up into sections of 25 minutes of work, followed by 5 minutes of break. This helps people like me, who have ADHD or trouble focusing, to stay vigilant and on task for the 25 minutes and then have a break after. It's very effective and another benefit is that 25+5 = 30, so it can be blocked in 30 minute / half-an-hour segments. The 25 minutes give you a feasible. balanced amount of both work and break.

I want to create an application designed for macOS users who want to organise their work sessions efficiently using this Pomodoro technique. The app should split work time into 30-minute blocks, composed of 25 minutes of focused work and 5 minutes of rest, displaying a timer on screen of when to start work, and 
Unlike many of the existing Pomodoro apps available and made for macOS right now, this project aims to offer a wide range of  options for end users to configure things like: start and end times, different settings for each day of the week, and personalize the appearance to their needs, more than just a simple dark/light mode.

I've found personally the free ones available for macOS currently are simply not extensive enough and lack customisability, while the paid ones are steeply priced for such a simple app.

The app is built with simplicity and user-centric customisation in mind, addressing the gap in the market where current Pomodoro apps either offer limited features, excessive costs, or confusing user interfaces.
